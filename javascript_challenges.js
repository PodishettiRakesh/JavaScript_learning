// Advanced Variables and Data Types
// MANUPULATE ARRAYS:

// Add an element to the beginning of an array.
// let arr=["raki","rakesh","rakhi","keerthi"]
// let arr2=["hemanth","kavya"]
// arr.unshift("ramu")
// console.log(arr.concat(arr2));
// arr.forEach(function(item){
//     console.log(item+item)
// });

// let num=[1,2,3,4]
// let dou=num.map(function(number){
//     return number*2;
// });
// console.log(dou)
// let evens=num.reduce(function(total,num){
//     return total+num;
// });
// console.log(num)
// console.log(evens);



// Remove the last element from an array.
// let numbers=[3,4,5,5,6,7]
// console.log(numbers.pop())
// console.log(numbers)


// Find the index of a specific element in an array
// console.log(numbers.indexOf(7))
